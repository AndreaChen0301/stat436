## Data Cleaning

```{r}
mortality <- read.csv("https://github.com/AndreaChen0301/stat436/raw/main/mortality_ph2.5.csv")%>%
  rename_at(vars(starts_with('X')), funs(sub("X", " ", .))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(!Country, names_to = "Year", values_to = "prematured_death")

welfare.percent <- read.csv("https://github.com/AndreaChen0301/stat436/raw/main/percent_welfare.csv")%>%
  rename_at(vars(starts_with('X')), funs(sub("X", " ", .))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(!Country, names_to = "Year", values_to = "cost_percent")

health = right_join(welfare.percent, mortality, c("Country", "Year")) %>%
  mutate(Year=as.numeric(Year))

# write.csv(health, "../data/mortality_welfare", row.names=FALSE)
```

```{r}
# countries with all 31 years of records, align with policy stringency index records

complete.country = read.csv("../data/co_emmit.csv") %>%

## Visulizations

### Premature Deaths Barplot:

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=11}
# % welfare cost on premature death (PM) out of total welfare cost on premature death + premature deaths line plot

# Based on the number of premature death, we pick the top 10 countries with most premature death to see 
# the percent of welfare cost of premature death caused by PM within welfare on all premature death.

# premature death bar plot
mortality = health %>%
  filter(Country %in% complete.country) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.character(Year)) %>%
  filter(Year == "1990" | Year == "2019")

top.10 = mortality %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(death = mean(prematured_death))%>%
  arrange(desc(death))%>%

### Percent of Welfare Cost on Premature Deaths caused by PM in Total Welfare Cost on Premature Death:
#### Compare its trend with premature deaths

```{r, fig.width=14, fig.height=10}

p = list()

p[["percent.plot"]] = health %>%
  filter(Country %in% top.10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=cost_percent), color = "darkgreen", size=1.2)+
  facet_grid(reorder(Country, -prematured_death)~.)+
  labs(x="Year", y="Percent of Welfare Cost", title="Percent of Cost on Premature Death of Total Welfare Cost from 1990-2019")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45),
        strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))

p[["death.plot"]] = health %>%
  filter(Country %in% top.10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=prematured_death), color = "steelblue4", size=1.2)+
  facet_grid(reorder(Country, -prematured_death)~.)+
  labs(x="Year", y="Numbers of Prematured Death", title="Prematured Death Caused by PM from 1990-2019")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45),
        strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))

p[["percent.plot"]] + p[["death.plot"]]
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
